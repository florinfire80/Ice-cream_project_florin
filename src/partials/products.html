        >Ice cream is a frozen dairy dessert obtained by freezing the ice cream
        mix with continuous agitation. It contains milk products, sweetening
        materials, stabilizers, colors, flavors, and egg products.<br />
        Ice cream had its origins in Europe and was introduced later in the
        United States where it developed into an industry.<br />Homemade ice
        cream is often made with a base of boiled custard. The mix, with
        flavourings, is poured into a canister surrounded with ice and salt or a
        refrigerator unit. The contents of the canister are agitated by means of
        a hand crank or electric motor until the ice cream is softly frozen.<br />The
        ice cream is usually allowed to harden further in a freezer.</span

        >Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either
        by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then
        serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold.<br />In
        hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as
        they dissolve faster. <br />Iced Coffee is what it sounds like: coffee
        that's been iced. Which means that iced coffee is brewed hot like
        regular coffee, and then cooled down. <br />This makes the taste and
        consistency of iced coffee very similar to that of regular coffee:
        bright flavors and familiar acidity.</span

        sold in a packaged system in a fast-food outlet. <br />Milkshake
