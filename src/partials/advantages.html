    Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream and
    flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice,
    such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It
    can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen
    together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The
    mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
    incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
    The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low
    temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its
    temperature increases. Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a
    spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones. Ice cream may be served with other
    desserts—such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats,
    sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and baked items.
